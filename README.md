# DigitalVet
A web application for veterinary clinics and veterinarians aimed at facilitating their comparison by users. The application provides users with the ability to consult reviews left by other users, allowing them to make informed decisions. Additionally, through the application, users can easily and efficiently schedule appointments.
For the project's implementation, I used the React.js and Java Spring Boot frameworks, as well as the MaterialUI library. For storing information, I utilized MySQL and Firebase Storage.

The source code is private.
